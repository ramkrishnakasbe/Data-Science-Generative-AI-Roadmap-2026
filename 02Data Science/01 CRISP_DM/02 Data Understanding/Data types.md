# Data Types

## What is Data?

Data is a collection of facts, observations, measurements, or information that can be analyzed to derive insights and support decision-making.

Examples:

| Customer_ID | Name | Age | Salary |
|------------|------|------|--------|
| 101 | Ram | 28 | 50000 |
| 102 | John | 31 | 70000 |

Here:

- Customer_ID → Data
- Name → Data
- Age → Data
- Salary → Data

# Why Understanding Data Types is Important

Before performing:

- Data Cleaning
- Data Analysis
- Data Visualization
- Machine Learning

we must understand the type of data we are working with.

Different data types require different handling techniques.

Examples:

| Data Type | Technique |
|------------|------------|
| Numerical | Scaling |
| Categorical | Encoding |
| Text | NLP |
| Images | Computer Vision |

# Classification of Data Types

```text
Data
│
├── Qualitative (Categorical)
│   │
│   ├── Nominal
│   └── Ordinal
│
└── Quantitative (Numerical)
    │
    ├── Discrete
    └── Continuous
```

# 1. Qualitative Data

Also called:

- Categorical Data
- Non-Numerical Data

Qualitative data describes qualities or categories.

It cannot be meaningfully measured using arithmetic operations.

---

## Examples

| Customer | Gender |
|-----------|-----------|
| A | Male |
| B | Female |

---

| Product | Category |
|----------|----------|
| iPhone | Electronics |
| Shoes | Fashion |

---

## Characteristics

- Represents categories
- Cannot be added or averaged
- Used for grouping

---

# Types of Qualitative Data

## 1. Nominal Data

Nominal means "Naming".

Categories have no order.

---

### Examples

Gender

| Value |
|---------|
| Male |
| Female |

---

Blood Group

| Value |
|---------|
| A |
| B |
| AB |
| O |

---

Country

| India |
| USA |
| Canada |

---

### Characteristics

- No ranking
- No ordering
- Only labels

---

### Machine Learning Handling

Convert using:

- One Hot Encoding
- Label Encoding

---

## 2. Ordinal Data

Categories have a meaningful order.

---

### Examples

Customer Satisfaction

| Rating |
|---------|
| Poor |
| Average |
| Good |
| Excellent |

---

Education

| Level |
|----------|
| High School |
| Bachelor's |
| Master's |
| PhD |

---

Salary Band

| Band |
|---------|
| Low |
| Medium |
| High |

---

### Characteristics

- Order exists
- Distance between categories unknown

Example:

Good > Average

But we don't know how much greater.

---

### Machine Learning Handling

Usually:

Ordinal Encoding

Example:

Poor = 1

Average = 2

Good = 3

Excellent = 4

---

# 2. Quantitative Data

Also called:

- Numerical Data

Contains measurable quantities.

Arithmetic operations are meaningful.

---

## Examples

| Employee | Salary |
|----------|---------|
| A | 50000 |
| B | 60000 |

---

| Student | Marks |
|----------|---------|
| A | 80 |
| B | 90 |

---

## Characteristics

- Numerical
- Measurable
- Arithmetic operations possible

---

# Types of Quantitative Data

## 1. Discrete Data

Countable values.

Cannot take every possible value.

Usually whole numbers.

---

### Examples

Number of Employees

| Department | Employees |
|-------------|-------------|
| IT | 50 |
| HR | 10 |

---

Number of Cars

Number of Defects

Number of Customers

---

### Characteristics

- Counted
- Whole numbers
- Finite values

---

### Examples

Valid:

```text
10
25
100
```

Invalid:

```text
10.5 employees
4.7 customers
```

---

## Real World Examples

### Banking

Number of Accounts

### Retail

Number of Products Sold

### Healthcare

Number of Patients

---

## 2. Continuous Data

Measured values.

Can take any value within a range.

---

### Examples

Height

```text
170.5 cm
172.75 cm
```

---

Weight

```text
65.2 kg
68.95 kg
```

---

Temperature

```text
36.5°C
37.8°C
```

---

Salary

```text
50000.75
80000.50
```

---

### Characteristics

- Infinite possibilities
- Decimal values allowed
- Measured not counted

---

## Real World Examples

### Healthcare

- Blood Pressure
- Weight
- Temperature

### Finance

- Revenue
- Profit

### Manufacturing

- Product Weight
- Machine Temperature

---

# Discrete vs Continuous

| Feature | Discrete | Continuous |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Nature | Counted | Measured |
| Values | Whole Numbers | Decimal Values |
| Example | Number of Customers | Customer Salary |
| Example | Number of Orders | Revenue |

---

# Qualitative vs Quantitative

| Feature | Qualitative | Quantitative |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Type | Categories | Numbers |
| Arithmetic | Not Meaningful | Meaningful |
| Example | Gender | Salary |
| Example | Country | Revenue |

---

# Real Data Science Examples

## Customer Churn Dataset

### Qualitative

- Gender
- Geography
- Product Type

### Quantitative

- Age
- Salary
- Balance

---

## Employee Attrition Dataset

### Qualitative

- Department
- Education Field
- Job Role

### Quantitative

- Salary
- Age
- Years Experience

---
